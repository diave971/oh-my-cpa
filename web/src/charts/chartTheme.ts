/**
 * Categorical series identities, in the order a legend reads them.
 *
 * A *series* is a category, not a verdict, which is what makes this the one palette in the app whose
 * hues are decoration. Everything else here resolves to a semantic token, where green means healthy and
 * red means failed; a model's colour cannot mean anything, because the model list is whatever the
 * deployment happens to serve. Borrowing the status hues for it would be worse than decoration - a green
 * line labelled "model B" beside a green pip that means "healthy" makes both unreadable - so the series
 * families are their own. See the measured bounds in docs/design.md and
 * docs/adr/0006-categorical-series-palette.md.
 *
 * A slot is a *rank*, not a model. Colour is assigned from the ranked list both dashboard panels share,
 * which is what guarantees a group's line and its ring slice are the same hue; it also means a group's
 * colour follows its rank, so it can change when the ranking does. The family is fixed per slot across
 * themes, so only the lightness step moves when the operator switches theme.

 * the first identity instead of vanishing or painting black. Nothing in the app currently asks for
 * more than six - the ranking keeps at most five named models plus a remainder - but a colour
 * function that silently returns `undefined` past its end is a chart drawn in the wrong colour, and
 * that is worse than one drawn in a repeated colour.
