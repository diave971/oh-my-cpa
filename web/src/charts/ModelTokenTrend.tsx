 * ModelTokenTrend draws each group's token volume over the window as one line.

 * **Why the mark is a line and not an area.** The KPI tiles above use an area because their series is
 * a fixed zero-filled grid where a quiet stretch is a *measured* zero, and an area carries that down
 * to the baseline so an empty stretch is distinguishable from an unmeasured one. Here six groups share
 * one plot, and six overlapping translucent fills stack into a mud that hides whichever model is
 * underneath - which is the reading the panel exists to provide. Lines separate; fills compound.
 *
 * **Why the legend is not the library's.** It is rendered by the panels as DOM beside the chart, for
 * two reasons. G2's legend is built from canvas-adjacent DOM with its own type scale, so it would be
 * the one place in the console not set in the mono stack; and the colour of a group has to be the same
 * in the trend's legend and in the usage list, which is only guaranteed if one list produces both. The
 * mark therefore draws no legend of its own.
 *
 * Animation is off. A mark that eases between two revisions reads as a repaint rather than as new
 * data, and the geometry swaps whenever the window or the ranking changes.
