 * ModelUsageDonut draws each group's share of the window's tokens as one ring.
 *
 * A ring rather than a filled pie, because the hole is where the total goes and a total inside the
 * reading is the one number the slices have to be read against. It is not a gauge: the ring shows
 * parts of a whole, so the arcs must sum to the centre rather than to an axis.
 *
 * **The centre label is DOM, not a chart annotation.** It is one number in the console's own type
 * scale with tabular numerals, and it must read at the same weight as the KPI values above it. A
 * canvas text mark would be the only data text on the page not set in the mono stack.
 *
 * **The readout overlays the square frame, not the outer wrapper.** The drawing's box is the frame's,
 * and the frame is kept square by CSS at whatever width the flex row leaves it, so the readout and
 * the arcs are measured against the same box. Anchoring the readout to the outer wrapper instead
 * would tie it to a box whose height is set by the row rather than by the drawing, which is how the
 * total came to sit off the ring's centre once the frame could be narrower than that row was tall.
 *
 * **The library's legend is disabled.** Colour has to mean the same thing here and in the trend, and
 * the ranked list beside the ring carries the numbers anyway - a legend with no values and a list
 * with values would be two renderings of the same ranking. See `ModelUsagePanels`, which owns that
 * list for both panels.
