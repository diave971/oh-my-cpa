/**
 * The palette model: nine authored tokens, seventeen derived ones, and the built-in
 * palettes each mode offers.
 *
 * **The split is the design.** A palette used to be thirty hand-tuned hex values, which
 * meant every palette was right by construction and no palette could be checked for
 * anything. Now a palette declares nine authored tokens - the page, its three surfaces,
 * the four text steps and the accent - and everything else is computed. Two consequences
 * follow, and both are deliberate:
 *
 * 1. A user-authored palette is possible at all. Nine values is a form; thirty is not.
 * 2. The tokens that must hold a *relationship* now hold it by construction rather than by
 *    review: the heatmap's quiet stop is the border-soft step because it is computed from
 *    it, the tooltip sits on the surface because it is computed to, and a filled accent
 *    control's label clears 4.5:1 because the fill is deepened until it does.
 *
 * The six built-in palettes are authored as nine tokens too, and their derived values are
 * computed like any other palette's. They are still hand-authored, just at nine values
 * instead of thirty. See `docs/adr/0011-theme-modes-and-derived-palettes.md` for the
 * formula, its constants, and the named places where it deliberately differs from the old
 * hand-tuned values.
