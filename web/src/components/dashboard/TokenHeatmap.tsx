 * wrong.
 *
 * **The shape is a field, not a timeline.** Seven weekday rows by a year of week columns. The
 * rows are the whole point: they make a weekly rhythm a *row* and a trend a *direction*, which a
 * single-row strip cannot show - and the shape and the span are one decision, since at seven rows
 * a quarter's worth of days would be thirteen columns rather than a field.
 *
 * **The year is drawn in full.** Days after today are simply days nothing is stored for: they are
 * not queried, so they render as `unrecorded` alongside every other day with no record. The panel
 * does not distinguish a day that has not happened from one whose records were pruned, because a
 * reader comparing days can only act on one thing - whether there is data for it.
 *
 * **The cells are DOM, not a chart mark.** `@ant-design/charts` is isolated in its own lazy chunk
 * and reaches the browser only from the trend marks above. A field of ~370 cells needs per-cell
 * text, focus and hit areas, so a canvas mark would need a parallel DOM layer for all three. See
 * docs/design.md §2 and ADR 0005.
 *
 * **Its span is a rolling fifty-three whole weeks**, ending on the week containing today. Fixed
 * rather than derived from the window picker: a field whose width is its own data's age is not a
 * calendar, and at the 24h default it would be a single column. A calendar year was the alternative
 * and it spends every January almost entirely empty while saying nothing about the December that
 * just ended - which is exactly the comparison a reader wants at that moment. The span is a whole
 * number of weeks so the current week is drawn complete, and the window picker still governs the
 * tiles above.
 *
 * **The days are the viewer's local days, built by the server in the viewer's zone.** A day is not
 * 24 hours in every zone on every date, and a single fixed offset is wrong for every day on the
 * far side of a daylight-saving transition. The response carries each day's exact bounds, and
 * those same bounds are what a click opens, so the cell and the list cannot disagree.
 *
 * Colour is a density ramp rather than a verdict - see docs/design.md §2 for the rules, which are
 * asserted from painted pixels by the browser probe.
