 *     the current choice out of its own menu made the operator unable to see which
 *     window they were on and unable to return to it after switching away.
 *   - An absolute range is validated before it is applied, because the server
 *     requires a positive window bounded at now.
 *
 * The list of presets is derived from `EVENT_PRESETS` rather than restated, so a
 * preset added there cannot be silently missing from the menu.
