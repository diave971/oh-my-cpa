 * The brand artwork a plugin publishes for the OAuth provider it registers.

 * key: the console's icon catalog can be a release behind a plugin that was
 * installed yesterday, and guessing "Codebuddy looks like <some other brand>"
 * mislabels the operator's own credential.
 *
 * The result is keyed by provider key, because that is what the credential, quota
 * and tab records carry. Both the declared OAuth provider key and the plugin id
 * are registered, since a plugin whose auths are typed by its own id (rather than
 * by `oauth_provider`) still has to resolve to the same logo.

 * bundle's contract is that a deployment has no CDN or static-file dependency, and the
 * console's own CSP allows images from itself or inline only (`img-src 'self' data:
 * blob:`). The plugin's own mark is still what gets drawn - the Go process fetches a
 * logo the plugin publishes and inlines it, so what arrives here is already inline
 * (`internal/api/management_plugin_logos.go`).
 *
 * The scheme is the boundary: `data:` is inert as an image source, whereas a
 * `javascript:` value must never reach the DOM at all. This is deliberately narrower
 * than `isSafeExternalURL`, which guards `<a href>` destinations - a link the operator
 * chooses to follow is not a resource the page loads by itself.

/**
 * pluginOAuthProviderLogos maps each plugin-registered OAuth provider to the logo

 *
 * A disabled plugin still contributes: switching a plugin off does not delete the
 * credentials it registered, and those credentials keep appearing on the credential,
 * quota and request-record surfaces with the provider they belong to. The mark is a
 * property of that identity, not of the plugin's current switch state, and dropping it
 * would leave exactly those rows with a placeholder - the defect this resolver exists to
 * prevent. The OAuth sign-in page is where a disabled plugin is excluded, because that is
 * where the plugin's *actions* live.
 *
 * The map has no prototype, because the keys come from plugins: a provider a plugin
 * happens to call `constructor`, `toString` or `__proto__` would otherwise read the
 * inherited member instead of the logo it published - the lookup would answer with a
 * function, and the plugin's own mark would silently be replaced by the fallback.
