 *     that does not exist, a pragma the database declined to answer, and a check
 *     that has never run are all different from a measured zero, and the page says
 *     which one it is looking at.
 *   - A version answer is a state, not a boolean. `update_available | up_to_date |
 *     update_ahead | indeterminate` exists because "the running build is a
 *     development or fork build" is not the same claim as "you are up to date".
