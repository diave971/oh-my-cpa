/**
 * Tests for the brand-artwork sync.
 *
 * The property being protected is that the README's artwork cannot drift from the console's accent.
 * That is not hypothetical: the repository used to hold four hand-maintained SVGs whose blue was
 * `#00A3FD` while the theme's accent was `#007AFF`, so the logo and the rest of the console were
 * already two different blues and nothing connected them. These tests drive the real script and
 * assert both halves of the fix - that the generated files carry the accent they are given, and that
 * the committed files are not stale.
