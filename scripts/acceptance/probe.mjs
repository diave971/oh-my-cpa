/**
 * Shared primitives for the focused browser probes.
 *
 * Each probe used to start its own Vite server and its own Chromium, mock the same
 * API surface, seed the same `localStorage` and install the same error capture.
 * Four probes therefore paid for four dev servers and four browsers to assert four
 * unrelated properties, and three of them sat outside the full gate entirely.
 *
 * The fix is ownership, not a helper: `runProbes` owns one server and one browser
 * for the whole run and gives each scenario its own *context*, which is where the
 * isolation actually lives. A context has its own `localStorage`, cookies and
 * service workers, so a scenario cannot see another's state, while the two
 * expensive resources are paid for once.
 *
 * A scenario's own routes are installed on its own context through `context.route`,
 * which is per-context and therefore cannot leak into a sibling. Routes are matched
 * in reverse order of registration, so a scenario's entries are checked before the
 * shared defaults.
