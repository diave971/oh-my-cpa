/**
 * The browser probe scenarios, as a registry rather than a script.
 *
 * Each scenario is a claim only a real engine can establish - geometry, stacking,
 * hit-testing, paint or virtualization - so none of them can move to the pure
 * suite. What they can share is their setup and their fixtures, which is why they
 * live here as data: `verify:probes` runs all of them against the built SPA in the
 * release gate, and `check:ui` runs the relevant subset against the dev server
 * during development.
 *
 * The implementations live in `probes/`, one module per product surface - the
 * provider console, the request records, the dashboard's charts, heatmap and model
 * panels, and the OMC settings page - and this file is the registry that orders
 * them. An id, its name, its route table and its viewport are stated once, here,
 * so the order the release gate runs them in is readable in one place.
 *
 * Nothing in this module or in `probes/` runs on import. That is deliberate:
 * `check:ui --list` and `--plan` must be able to answer without starting a
 * browser, and a module that spawned a server at import time could not support
 * that.
