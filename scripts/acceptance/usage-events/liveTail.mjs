  // itself. This is the largest wait left in the suite.
  //
  // The bound is derived rather than hand-picked, and it is deliberately generous:
  // three cadences of headroom, not one. Under CPU contention (a 2-CPU constraint,
  // or the probes running beside this suite) a 30s bound - three intervals - was
  // observed to expire while the page was merely slow, so the assertion reported a
  // failure that said nothing about the code. The wait is for a positive event, so
  // a longer bound costs nothing on a healthy machine: it returns as soon as the
  // pill appears.
  //
  // Driving it with `page.clock` was tried and rejected. Installing the clock before
  // the first navigation does make the interval fire early - 11s of app time in
  // ~900ms - but the same mock also covers `requestAnimationFrame` and
  // `performance.now`, which is exactly what `smoothScroll`'s gesture schedule is
  // built from. With the clock installed the back-to-top gesture landed at 37px
  // instead of the top, with no page error, so the one assertion this block exists
  // for was the one it broke. Isolating the interval from the frame clock is not
  // expressible through the Playwright clock API, and the trade was nine seconds
  // against the correctness of a scroll assertion, so the honest wait stays.
