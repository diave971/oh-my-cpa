/**
 * Tests for the affected-check planner behind `pnpm test:fast`.
 *
 * Two things are asserted here, and the second is the one that keeps the gate
 * cheap:
 *
 * 1. **Coverage.** Editing a test suite, the test harness, or the planner itself
 *    selects a check. All three previously selected nothing, so a change made to
 *    turn a test green was verified by no gate at all.
 * 2. **No browser, ever.** For every path in the representative corpus below, the
 *    plan must contain no check that builds the SPA, builds a Go binary, starts
 *    Vite, starts Chromium or starts the fake CPA. That is a property of the plan
 *    rather than of a command list, so it is asserted against the plan directly.
