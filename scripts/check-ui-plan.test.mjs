/**
 * Tests for the `check:ui` scenario planner.
 *
 * Two families of property matter here, and they pull in opposite directions.
 *
 * **Narrowing must be real.** If every change ran every scenario the fast path would
 * cost the same as the release gate and there would be no point to it. So the common
 * cases are asserted to select a specific, small set.
 *
 * **Narrowing must never be silent.** The dangerous failure is not a slow plan, it is
 * a fast one that skipped the scenario which would have caught the bug. Every rule
 * that widens - the shared layer, an unrecognised frontend path, the probe framework
 * itself - is therefore asserted from the failing side: a plan that omitted those
 * would be a green run that verified nothing.
