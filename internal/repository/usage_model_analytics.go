// QueryUsageModelBuckets aggregates one window per group per bucket, ordered by

//
// **It reads the detail table only, and never the hourly or daily rollup.**
// `QueryUsageAnalytics` splits its window at the aggregation checkpoint and reads the two
// halves from different tables, and that split is not reusable here. Its boundary is a
// *timestamp*, while the rollup's unit of read is a whole row whose start can precede that
// boundary: an event timestamped inside an already-folded hour that arrived late stays on
// the detail side of the boundary while its own hour is already inside the rollup, so both
// halves count it. In a windowed total that artefact is a quiet double count; in a
// per-model ranking it also reorders models, which is the kind of wrong that still looks
// plausible. One source has no boundary to get wrong - the argument ADR 0005 already made
// for the daily token grid.
//
// The cost is a scan of the retained detail rows rather than a read of the rollup, bounded
// by the retention horizon rather than by total history. Its callers are panels that read
// on their own cadence rather than on the dashboard's live tail poll, and
// `BenchmarkQueryUsageModelBuckets` pins the budget.
//
// The measure is `total_tokens`, the column CPA's own accounting persisted, rather than a
// sum of the individual token columns: cached and cache-read tokens overlap between
// providers, so reconstructing a total from them would double count whichever convention a
// given event followed.
//
// Rows are ordered by group then bucket as part of the contract, not as a convenience: the
// caller's fold walks one group at a time and never builds a map of maps.
