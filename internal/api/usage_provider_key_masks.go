/**
 * Provider key masks answer "which of this provider's keys served the request?"
 * on a request record.
 *
 * CPA's usage payload carries no provider key. What it carries is the runtime
 * `auth_index` of the credential CPA selected, which is stable for a configured
 * credential, and the keys themselves live only in CPA's configuration. The mask
 * is therefore resolved here, at read time, from the credential lists CPA
 * reports - the four config API-key families and the openai-compatibility
 * providers - and returned on the record as `provider_key_mask`.
 *
 * Three properties bound what this can answer, and each is deliberate:
 *
 *   - **It resolves against the configuration as it is read, not as it was at
 *     request time.** A credential that has since been rotated or deleted stops
 *     being offered as that index's owner, so the row prints nothing. The console
 *     cannot reconstruct a key it can no longer read, and printing a plausible
 *     one would be a fabrication. A provider that was only switched off is not a
 *     removal: it reports no index to claim, so it resolves to nothing on its own,
 *     while the key that served a request before the switch-off stays named.
 *   - **A mask is not an identity, and neither is an index on its own.** An index
 *     claimed by more than one credential resolves to nothing rather than to
 *     whichever entry was read first: one key's mask on another key's request is
 *     worse than no mask at all. This is the same rule the repository applies when
 *     it joins a record to a discovered resource.
 *   - **The plaintext key never leaves this process** except toward the credential
 *     list the operator is editing, which is what ADR 0015 fixes. Only
 *     `security.MaskSecret` output is ever stored in this cache or returned to the
 *     browser, and the browser renders it as a label without asking for anything.
 *
 * The read is best effort. A CPA that is down, slow or missing a family leaves the
 * records' masks empty and returns the request list unchanged: a display label
 * must not be able to fail the page whose job is to show request history.
