// providerWriteGate serialises every whole-list read-modify-write this console
// performs against the CPA provider configuration.
//
// CPA stores each provider family as one list and exposes no per-entry write:
// changing one provider means reading the list, editing one element, and PUTting
// the whole list back. Two of those interleaved read an identical snapshot and
// the later PUT discards the earlier one, so the earlier operator's toggle is
// silently reverted while both requests report success. A per-entry guarantee
// cannot be built on top of a whole-list write, so the window in which the list
// is being replaced has to be exclusive.
//
// The gate is deliberately one global permit rather than one per family. The
// cost is negligible for a console where a write is a single round trip, and it
// also covers the configuration source writer, which replaces the whole
// configuration document rather than one family inside it.
//
// Acquisition is bounded and cancellable: a caller that cannot enter the window
// within the timeout is told the console is busy instead of parking a goroutine
// on the lock. Nothing is written to CPA when acquisition fails, which is what
// makes that refusal safe for the client to retry.
