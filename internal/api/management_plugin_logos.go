/**
 * Plugin-declared logos are fetched here, by the process, rather than by the
 * browser that renders them.
 *
 * A plugin publishes its logo as an absolute URL, usually on a CDN, and the console
 * needs the plugin's own mark: a provider's brand is the plugin's to declare, and the
 * console's vendored icon catalog cannot be updated by installing a plugin. But the
 * bundle's contract is that a deployment has no CDN or static-file dependency - the
 * SPA is served from the Go binary, and its own CSP allows images only from itself or
 * inline (`img-src 'self' data: blob:`) - so a browser-side fetch of that URL would
 * both break offline operation and contradict the policy the console is served under.
 *
 * Fetching it here resolves the two: the mark is the plugin's, and the browser only
 * ever loads an inline `data:` URL. The response is bounded, must be an image type
 * this console is willing to render, and is cached - including failures, since the
 * console polls the plugin list and an unreachable host must not be retried on every
 * poll. A logo that cannot be inlined is reported as absent, which is what makes the
 * surfaces fall back to the catalog mark.
