// the detail rows instead of the rollup, which is far more expensive than the KPI tiles'
// read; attaching it to `/management/dashboard` would pay that cost on every live tail poll,
// which fires as often as every five seconds. It answers for the window the picker selected
// but on its own cadence, and it is allowed to fail alone: an unavailable read leaves the six
// tiles and the activity grid beside it readable.

// `call` (the call point the client requested). The call view is what a deployment's own
// vocabulary names: one call point served by several upstream variants is one group here,
// because the split between them is the gateway's routing detail rather than a difference
// the caller chose. An unrecognised value is a 400 rather than a silent fallback, so a
// typo cannot quietly change what the numbers mean.
