// The grid is a rolling year: fifty-three whole Monday-first weeks ending on the week containing
// today.
//
// Rolling rather than a calendar year because the question the panel answers is "what has my usage
// been doing lately", and that is a trailing window: a calendar grid spends every January almost
// entirely empty and shows nothing at all about last December, which is exactly the comparison a
// reader wants at that moment. GitHub's own graph is the same shape for the same reason.
//
// The span is fixed rather than derived from the dashboard's window picker: a field whose width is
// its own data's age is not a calendar, and at the 24h default it would be a single column. The
// window picker still governs the six KPI tiles above it, which is why the panel says which axis it
// owns.
//
// Because the window ends today there are no days still to come, so every cell in it is either a
// record or the absence of one - which is the only distinction a reader can act on.
