// checks on load and is loaded far more often than a release is published, so fifteen page
// views could spend the whole allowance for every client behind that address, including
// other tools the operator runs. That is not hypothetical: it is what happened, and the
// console reported the exhausted limit instead of a version.
//
// The arithmetic is what sets the value. A check is at most two requests per product and
// there are two products, so one refresh costs at most four requests; at a fifteen-minute
// floor that is at most four refreshes an hour, sixteen requests, leaving well over half of
// the shared budget for everything else on the address. A shorter floor does not fit: five
// minutes allows forty-eight requests an hour and leaves almost no headroom, which is the
// state that produced the failure.
//
